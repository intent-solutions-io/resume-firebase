## SCENE 1: THE HOOK

**[0:00 - 0:30]**

*FADE IN on presenter, warm lighting, professional background*

---

**OPE**
*(looking directly at camera, slight smile)*

Every year, over 200,000 veterans leave the military.

*(beat)*

They have years of leadership experience. Technical skills. Security clearances.

*(slight pause, lean in)*

But their resumes? They read like a foreign language to civilian employers.

*(gesture to screen)*

That's where this comes in.

*OPE turns to screen, CLICK - intake page appears*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*

This... is Operation Hired's AI Resume Generator.

Veterans upload their military documents.

*(snap fingers)*

Sixty seconds later? A professional, ATS-optimized resume. Ready to send.

Let me show you exactly how it works.

---

## SCENE 2: THE CANDIDATE JOURNEY

**[0:30 - 1:30]**

*SCREEN: Intake form at resume-gen-intent-dev.web.app/intake*

---

**OPE**
*(typing while talking)*

So a veteran lands here. Simple form.

Name...

*(types "Marcus Johnson")*

Email...

*(types "marcus.johnson@email.com")*

Their branch of service...

*Click dropdown, select "Army"*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*

Rank... MOS - that's their military job code.

*(types "E-7" and "11B")*

An 11 Bravo is Army Infantry, by the way. One of the most common.

*Hovers over "Continue to Documents" button*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*
*(slight smile)*

One click, and they're in.

*CLICK*

---

## SCENE 3: THE UPLOAD

**[1:30 - 2:30]**

*SCREEN: Document upload page*

---

**OPE**

Now here's where the magic starts.

*(gestures to upload zone)*

They drag and drop their military documents. DD-214 - that's the discharge paper, the holy grail. Evaluations. Training records. Whatever they've got.

*Drags PDF file into upload zone*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*

The system accepts PDF, Word docs, even plain text files.

*File uploads, progress bar completes*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*
*(nods at screen)*

Uploaded. Secure. Encrypted in Google Cloud.

*Hovers over "Submit Documents" button*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*

Now we submit... and let the AI do its thing.

*CLICK*

---

## SCENE 4: THE TRANSFORMATION

**[2:30 - 3:30]**

*SCREEN: Processing status page*

---

**OPE**

This is the moment.

*Clicks "Generate My Resume" button*

*Status indicator starts spinning*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*
*(watching screen)*

Behind the scenes, Google's Vertex AI is reading every document. Extracting years of service, deployments, leadership roles, certifications...

*Status changes to "Processing..."*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*

And translating all of that military jargon...

*Status changes to "Building Resume..."*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*

...into language that civilian hiring managers actually understand.

*Status changes to "Resume Ready!" - green checkmark appears*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*
*(genuine smile, slight excitement)*

And just like that. Done.

*Points to download buttons*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*

PDF for printing. Word doc for editing or uploading to job sites.

Both are ATS-optimized. That means they'll pass through those automated screening systems that reject 75% of resumes before a human ever sees them.

*CLICK - downloads PDF*

---

## SCENE 5: THE RESULT

**[3:30 - 4:00]**

*SCREEN: PDF resume opens*

---

**OPE**
*(scrolling through resume)*

Look at this.

Professional summary at the top. Civilian-friendly.

Skills section - pulled directly from their training and evaluations.

Work experience - their military roles, translated. No acronyms. No jargon.

*(scrolls to bottom)*

Education. Certifications. Everything organized, formatted, ready to go.

*Closes PDF*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*

A veteran could spend days trying to write this themselves.

*(holds up one finger)*

We did it in sixty seconds.

---

## SCENE 6: THE COMMAND CENTER

**[4:00 - 4:45]**

*SCREEN: Switch to admin dashboard tab*

---

**OPE**

Now, on the operations side...

*Admin dashboard appears*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*

This is our command center.

*(gestures across screen)*

Every candidate. Their status. When they started. Whether their resume is ready.

*Points to status cards at top*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*

Quick glance - total candidates, resumes ready, anyone stuck in processing, any errors that need attention.

*Clicks on a candidate row*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*

Click into any candidate...

*Detail page loads*

**OPE** *(cont'd)*

Full profile. Documents they uploaded. Preview of their generated resume. Download buttons right here.

*(points to link)*

And this link? Shareable. Send it to an employer, send it to the veteran, bookmark it for later.

---

## SCENE 7: THE CLOSE

**[4:45 - 5:00]**

*OPE turns back to camera*

---

**OPE**
*(confident, direct)*

That's Operation Hired's AI Resume Generator.

Military documents in. Professional resume out. Sixty seconds.

*(slight pause)*

We're helping veterans land civilian jobs. Faster.

*(nod)*

And this is just the beginning.
