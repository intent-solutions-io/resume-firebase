# Operation Hired Resume Generator

## The Problem

**70% of veteran resumes never make it past Applicant Tracking Systems.**

Military experience doesn't translate. Terms like "E-7," "NCOER," or "supervised 47 personnel in CONUS/OCONUS operations" mean nothing to civilian recruiters or ATS algorithms. Veterans struggle to articulate their value, and employers miss out on exceptional talent.

---

## The Solution

**AI-powered military-to-civilian resume translation with full transparency.**

Our platform converts military documents (DD-214, evaluations, awards) into ATS-optimized civilian resumes - and shows veterans exactly how the translation works.

## The 3-Document Bundle

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Military Resume** | Preserves military terminology for defense contractors & federal roles |
| **Civilian Resume** | Fully translated for corporate recruiters and ATS systems |
| **Crosswalk Document** | Side-by-side comparison showing how each military term translates |

**The Crosswalk is our secret weapon.** No black-box AI. Veterans see and understand exactly how their experience translates to civilian value.
